      404: Purpose not found. Just kidd--This website is created to exhibit my photos, journey, and some random crazy thoughts. 
      <br> <br> After covid, I became really bad at expressing. Inputs are always continuiing, but ideas just stay in my head and
      never had a chance to come out. Even if they did come out, they are often entangled with fragments. Redundancy, omission, 
      incoherence, lack of integration, and a sense of overloading... Wechat moments seems to be a good place to dump something,
      but not really. I was limited to post a maximum of 9 photos with a short description(maybe just 1 emoji). Because of this
      I started to get used to expressing more of little chunks, random thoughts, than expressing my reflections as a "flow".
      So based on all of the above, the purpose of making this website is to: <br> <br> 1. find the "flow" experience in writing 
      <br> <br>2. apply this "flow" in other investigations, to grow a plant, not just germinate the seed.
      <br> <br>3. challenge myself to become naturally logical when writing, speaking, or just expressing in general
      <br> <br>4. be curious and critical about the world 

      <br> <br>There will certainly be judgements, good or bad, from audience or myself. The world itself is made of judgements.
      I hope the fear of judgements will not stop me from finding the "flow", instead, encourage me to improve my writing logics. 

      <br> <br>Anyway, this is just for myself as a reference. 

      I hope you will enjoy exploring about my adventures, and maybe finding some
      inspirations too!
